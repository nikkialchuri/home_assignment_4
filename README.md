1. GAN Architecture

Explain the adversarial process in GAN training. What are the goals of the generator and discriminator, and how do they improve through competition? Diagram of the GAN architecture showing the data flow and objectives of each component.













2. Ethics and AI Harm

Choose one of the following real-world AI harms discussed in Chapter 12:
•	Representational harm
•	Allocational harm
•	Misinformation in generative AI
Describe a real or hypothetical application where this harm may occur. Then, suggest two harm mitigation strategies that could reduce its impact based on the lecture.











3. Programming Task (Basic GAN Implementation)

Implement a simple GAN using PyTorch or TensorFlow to generate handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
Requirements:
•	Generator and Discriminator architecture
•	Training loop with alternating updates
•	Show sample images at Epoch 0, 50, and 100
Deliverables:
•	Generated image samples
•	Screenshot or plots comparing losses of generator and discriminator over time











4. Programming Task (Data Poisoning Simulation)

Simulate a data poisoning attack on a sentiment classifier.
Start with a basic classifier trained on a small dataset (e.g., movie reviews). Then, poison some training data by flipping labels for phrases about a specific entity (e.g., "UC Berkeley").
Deliverables:
•	Graphs showing accuracy and confusion matrix before and after poisoning
•	How the poisoning affected results








5. Legal and Ethical Implications of GenAI

Discuss the legal and ethical concerns of AI-generated content based on the examples of:
•	Memorizing private data (e.g., names in GPT-2)
•	Generating copyrighted material (e.g., Harry Potter text)
Do you believe generative AI models should be restricted from certain data during training? Justify your answer.










6. Bias & Fairness Tools

Visit Aequitas Bias Audit Tool.
Choose a bias metric (e.g., false negative rate parity) and describe:
•	What the metric measures
•	Why it's important
•	How a model might fail this metric
Optional: Try applying the tool to any small dataset or use demo data.
